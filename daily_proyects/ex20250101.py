# Lists are one of the most heavily used datatypes in Python. They are designed to store multiple other Python datatypes such as numbers, strings, and any other type. For todayâ€™s task, you need to process the following two lists:
# 
# list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 3]
# list2 = [7, 2, 5, 9, 8]
# Specifically, your task is to:
# 
# 1. Place the two lists in a .py file.
# 2. Add some code that combines the two lists into one single list.
# 3. Removes any duplicates from the combined list.
# 4. Sort the combined list in ascending order.
# 5. Print out the sorted list.
#
# output:
# [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 3]
list2 = [7, 2, 5, 9, 8]

combined_list = list(set(list1 + list2))

combined_list.sort()

print(combined_list)
