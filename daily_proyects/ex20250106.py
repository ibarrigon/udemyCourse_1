# Write a program that removes duplicate items from a list while keeping the original order. The program should return
# a new list with only unique elements. You can place the following list in your script and then add the code that
# removes duplicates and prints out the new list.
#
# numbers = [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 2]
# We provide two different solutions to this problem behind the “Show Code” button and compare the two discussing 
# which is the best code.
#
# Expected Output
# The program should print out the text “List without duplicates:” followed by the cleaned list.
# List without duplicates: [ 3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
