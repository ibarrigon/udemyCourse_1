# Letâ€™s have another project on lists since they are a key data type in Python whenever we need to store multiple 
# items.
# 
# Your task for today is to write a program that merges two lists into one and removes any common items between 
# them.
# 
# Start by pasting these two lists in an empty Python script:
# 
# list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
# Then, add some code so your program should:
# 
# Merge these two lists into one single list.
#
# Remove the common/duplicate items
# 
# Print out the updated list.
# Here is what the program should print out after you run it:
# [1, 2, 5, 6]
