# Images

This course module shows how to work with images, and use some kind of arrays (numpy)

## Libraries

1. numpy
2. opencv-python

## Errors

In ther first file work_images.py, when we work inside the docker container, we get an error. We need further 
investigation to work with this.

### Error

This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
